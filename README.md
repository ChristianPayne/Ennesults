# Ennesults

## What is Ennesults.js?
Ennesults is a Twitch bot designed to kindly insult random people in chat. Originally designed for [Ennegineer](https://www.twitch.tv/ennegineer/), this bot can be altered to be more of a general bot as well. NodeJS is required to run Ennesults at this time.

## Tech behind Ennesults
Ennesults is always evolving so technologies behind her will be changing in the future. Currently, Ennesults has been built primarily with NodeJS.

## Future Development Plans
I plan on adding many things to Ennesults. There are no timelines established mainly because this is just a side project at the moment.

In no particular order:
- Web hosting to be a cloud bot.
- Browser source support for running inside OBS.
- Web dashboard for bot controls.
- Easy setup of the bot for new users.
